Miscellaneous tools
===================

In this section, we give an overview of various tools and patterns that can be useful for quick data analysis.
The aim of these tools is not to reinvent standard Python functionality or imitate extensive third-party plotting and data libraries.
In stead, we use a minimalistic approach to achieve quick (and often dirty) results.
It's main purpouse is to bundle repeating initialization patterns and parameters into reusable units, and thus preserve simplicity and improve readability of scripts.
Any more insights, and suggestion for best practices are welcomed.
