| Scientific Numerical Tools v2

.. note::

   Currently a new C++ version of this project is being prepared in a separate `SciNumTools v3 github repository <https://github.com/vrtulka23/scinumtools3>`_.

Python module ``scinumtools`` is an open source collection of various routines used in everyday programming and analysis of numerical simulations. 
Source code and documentation of the ``scinumtools`` package is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/vrtulka23/scinumtools>`_ and Python package is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/scinumtools/>`_.

The module is divided into following sections:

:ref:`solver/index:expression solver`
     
  Universal expression solver that can be easily modified and adapted for other projects

:ref:`units/index:physical units`
     
  Physical routines and manipulation with dimensional quantities

:ref:`materials/index:material properties`

  Calculator of atomic properties from chemical formulas

:ref:`dip/index:dimensional input parameters`
     
  Parser of dimensional input parameters serialization language

:ref:`misc/index:miscellaneous tools`

  A collection of various usefull scripts and patterns for data analysis
